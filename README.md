Project Overview: The project involves the application of data analytics techniques to satellite imagery for the purpose of optimizing the placement of Aadhar centers. Aadhar is a unique identification system in India, and the optimization of center locations likely aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency in providing Aadhar-related services.

Key Components:

GeoTIFF Data:

Purpose: GeoTIFF files contain geospatial raster data, likely representing satellite images.
Usage in Code: The Rasterio library is used to open and read a GeoTIFF file (2022_India.tif) that presumably contains relevant satellite data.
Data Processing with NumPy:

Purpose: NumPy is employed for efficient numerical operations and array manipulations on pixel data extracted from the satellite image.
Usage in Code: NumPy is used to handle pixel data, manipulate arrays, and facilitate various operations required for data analysis.
K-Means Clustering:

Purpose: The scikit-learn library's KMeans class is utilized for clustering black pixel coordinates within the satellite image.
Usage in Code: K-means clustering is applied iteratively to identify optimal cluster centers, likely representing significant features in the satellite data.
Data Visualization with Matplotlib:

Purpose: Matplotlib is used for visualizing the satellite image, displaying cluster centers, and showcasing the final results of the k-means clustering.
Usage in Code: The Matplotlib library is employed to create a visual representation of the original image, highlight cluster centers, and visualize the outcome of the clustering process.
Iterative Approach: The script follows an iterative approach to k-means clustering by gradually reducing the number of candidate centers. The optimal cluster centers, determined through the clustering process, are visualized on the original satellite image.
